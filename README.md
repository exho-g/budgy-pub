Your ideal budget tracker.

## Aren't there already a ton of budget tracking app?

Well, yeah — but not a lot of them support what I need. Some apps have certain features I want, but others don’t. And a lot of the time, even the basic stuff is locked behind a paywall.

I get it — they need to make money. But for me? If I want something that actually fits my needs, I might as well build it myself.

So... here it is: Budgy!
